We had an overview of different models of (∞,2)-categories, as well as some constructions thereof, such as the Gray tensor product and (∞,2)-limits. We also considered some applications of (∞,2)-category theory in derived algebraic geometry, topological quantum field theory, and K-theory.
Here is a detailed program of the seminar.
